            I hadn’t thought about what I wanted to do with art. Do I want to be a full-time artist after pursuing art school? Do I want to paint more? With all these interests, including art, I knew I needed to choose what I wanted to do. That’s when I realized I enjoy the digital world, wanting to learn more each day. Then it hit me. If I like art and technology, I could pursue a Graphic Design degree and become a Graphic Designer. Graphic Designers combine art and technology, creating a world of newfound experiences. Not only do they rely on imagination alone, but also on the wonders of technology and its knowledge. Later, I decided to enroll in a Graphic Design class. Knowing what to expect, we had the chance to use Adobe software such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. Starting with Photoshop, I struggled a bit with creating geometric shapes.  If you notice the South Park character I designed during class, the body and shoes were done easily; however, perfectly shaping the head and hair was surely an obstacle. Thankfully, the steps were clear, and I finished creating my character. Next, we started an assignment that was quite challenging. Based on the third image of the girl with mismatched features, I had to incorporate photoshopping different photos together to create a monster. A difficulty with this small project was photo editing, since our images had to be clean and crisp.
             Overall, I’m happy with how these turned out and cannot wait to see where this degree will lead me.

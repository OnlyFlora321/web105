     <h2>Digital Art</h2>
        <div class="Digital">
            <p class="centered-paragraph">I was not introduced to Digital Art until I first found out on YouTube. I find the visuals very appealing when drawn on electronics such as an iPad, computer, or even on a phone screen with either a pen or a finger. Before Digital Art, drawing on paper was my means of art. When I first started drawing digitally, it was difficult switching to something new after getting used to the feel of paper and pencil at my fingertips. It took me a long time to adapt to my new environment. Thankfully, I started with something small, like a simple tablet screen, to ease the struggle. Of course, adapting was still the same, which led me to my first drawing program called Ibis Paint X. I learned how to navigate between different types of brush tools, experimented with brush density, understood the airbrush tool and its capabilities, and learned tons of tips and tricks. After some time, I moved on to a new drawing software known as Clip Studio Paint, where I drew the drawings shown on screen. Each drawing depicts a heartfelt meaning that reflects a moment and feeling. An example is the drawing of the potato I drew for my best friendâ€™s birthday. I imagined a fairytale theme where my friend magically leaps in the sky to catch the fallen potato. The fun part about this piece was shading and drawing the excitement the potato had. Of course, the two other drawings I drew hold deep meanings too. 
                One is a drawing of the well-known Miku, and another is a smiling girl. </p>

    <h2>Traditonal Art</h2>
        <div class="Traditional">
           <p>
            Before any type of art, traditional art was the first form of art I started with. Drawing with paper and pencil makes me feel nostalgic and brings back memories of when I first started drawing in 2nd grade. I remember one day sitting in class as we were working on our art projects. The rule was not to peek at others' art until told to do so; however, I soon stood up and went for a tissue before accidentally peeking at one of the artworks. I was mesmerized by the work of art someone else drew, as thatâ€™s how my love for art came about. Happy mistakes, they all say, which I can agree with. Day and day, I practiced my art and learned so much. I mainly learned how to draw in certain styles and characters, as well as props and more. I also tried my best learning perspective, as shown with the girl holding an ice cream. I was beyond astonished when I drew her because this was something random and not at all supposed to be so well-perspective-wise. As for the charcoal artwork, it was one of the assignments I was assigned in art class. Our assignment was to match the following picture shown with charcoal, and the process was fun but messy. I enjoyed blending in the charcoal bits and creating the final piece. What was surprising about this project was that we had to draw the picture upside down, which was then adjusted right side up. 
            In all, I enjoyed these experiments and am looking forward to drawing more.
